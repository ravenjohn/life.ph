            <h3>WATERSHED MANAGEMENT PLANNING APPROACH FOR WATER QUALITY</h3>
            <hr>
            <small>By <a><strong>Wowee Dollente</strong></a></small> &mdash; <small>Dec. 21, 2012</small> &mdash; <small>filed under <a>Eco</a></small>

            <p>A watershed is an area of land that drains to a common point such as a stream, river, pond, or lake. It can be compared to either a leaf or a funnel. The edge of a leaf defines the watershed area. Its main veins and sub veins can be equated with the watershed's main river and its tributaries. The watershed is also like a funnel, on the other hand, that collects all water falling within it and channeling it into a discharge point/opening.</p>

            <p>On a broad scale, imagine a mountain and think of the highest ridges as defining the area of the watershed. Rain and wind from the ridges carry pollutants from the sides and ridges of the mountain into the waters below.  If we, therefore, properly manage land activities from the mountain sides and areas below, we will protect the water within the watershed.  This concept is the same for any and all watersheds.</p>

            <p>Environmental problems caused by human activities such as domestic and industrial wastes have polluted some major watersheds in the Philippines. Several attempts have been made to clean-up impaired bodies of water. Many of these attempts have been unsuccessful because the clean-up efforts did not recognize the fact that the specific bodies of water are a part of a watershed.  The clean-up efforts only focus on the specific river or lake that needed to be cleaned.  The upstream and other tributaries have been neglected but which are also contributors of pollutants to the river or lake.  Hence, the development of the “brick-by-brick” approach by the Lasallian Institute For the Environment (LIFE) for watershed management, where, in order to clean up a specific lake or river, the sub-basins (the major and minor tributaries that feed them) are also in most cases must first be addressed. This approach also requires stakeholders in the community to work together.</p>
