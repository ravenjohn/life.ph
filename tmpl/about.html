            <h1>Genesis of LIFE</h1>
            <p>Faced with environmental issues surrounding the country, the Philippine Lasallian Family, through the Synod Mission Action Plan, established the Lasallian Institute for the Environment or LIFE as a response to the challenge for Lasallians to be better stewards of God's creation.  LIFE is geared not only towards cursory environmental clean-up projects, but towards a sustainable environmental development through the education and values formation of Lasallians and the Philippine society.</p>

            <p>LIFE is actively pushing a number of important undertakings complementary to each other for the significant improvement in the environment. These are the Brick-by-Brick Approach in the clean-up of Laguna Lake, planting One Million Trees and Beyond, and the Eco-camp programs.</p>

            <h1>Mission</h1>
            <p>We, the Lasallian Institute For the Environment (LIFE), fulfilling our roles as stewards of Godâ€™s creation, aim to educate children, teachers, Lasallians and others in Natural Resources Management (NRM). We aim to help them not only to love and appreciate the environment, but also to understand and take care of it as well. LIFE strives to provide education with values formation.</p>

            <hr>

            <h1>Vision</h1>
            <p>LIFE envisions a society of people who not only love their environment but understand and respect it as well. We see Lasallians and others actively learning about what the environment is, its importance and how it affects our lives. We see the communities participating in data and information collection and sharing their knowledge and learning with other people. They do this not only inside the classroom but outside the real world as well.</p>

            <h1>Objectives</h1>
            <ul>
              <li>To educate (formally and experientially)</li>
              <li>To raise awareness</li>
              <li>To form values</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Organizational Statement</h4>
            <p>The De La Salle Philippines (DLSP) had committed themselves to the Lasallian Mission of providing a human and Christian education to the young, especially in schools, with the service of the poor as priority, in order to evangelize and catechize, to promote peace, justice, and integrity of creation, accomplishing these together in association.</p>

            <p>LIFE, as part of the Lasallian Family, is also committed to provide environmental education and awareness not only to the Lasallian community but non-Lasallians as well. This is to ensure formation of values that will be instilled in each and everyone and understanding on how important our environment is and what it should mean in our every day lives.</p>
